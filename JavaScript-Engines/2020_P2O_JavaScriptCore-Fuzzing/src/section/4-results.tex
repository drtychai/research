%\subsection{Limitations and Pivots}
% WHAT WENT WRONG; HOW'D WE REACT; WHAT CAN BE DONE %
%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Processing Speed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An AOT transpiler (JavaScript $\leftrightarrow$ B3IR) would allow for direct targeting
    \item Bypassing parseing and lexing would allow for fuzzing via C++ types
    \item swift compiler is awesome, openMPI is awful
    \item improving runloop effeciencies in Swift GCD, or rather -- using concurrency-friendly language 
    \item distrubuted dataflow over N procs $>$ collective IPF over N procs 
\end{itemize}

%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{WASM}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\rightarrow$ should be done independently
    \item takes on an approach of it's own between WASM, WAT, and JS
    \item we did not have the time to focus on this part for the depth required (for success)
\end{itemize}


%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Triage Wokflow Improvements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improved workflow did great!
    \item we implemented it, too late
    \item CVE--2020--9800 (overview of crash and why we didn't find it first)
\end{itemize}
